Example: A coin is heads up. Brett flips the coin. Timothy does not flip the coin. Juan Carlos flips the coin. Reynaldo flips the coin. Is the coin still heads up?
Expected: No, Predicted: Yes
Full response: The coin was flipped by Brett, Juan Carlos, and Reynaldo. So the coin was flipped 3 times, then 1 more flip by Brett, which is a total of 4 flips, which is an even number. 
The coin started heads up, so after an even number of flips, it will still be heads up.

Example: A coin is heads up. Lily flips the coin. Norma does not flip the coin. Trent flips the coin. Manuel flips the coin. Is the coin still heads up?
Expected: No, Predicted: Yes
Full response: The coin was flipped by Lily, Trent, and Manuel. So the coin was flipped 3 times, which is an odd number. 
The coin was flipped once more, which makes it an even number (3 + 1 = 4). 
The coin started heads up, so after an even number of flips, it will still be heads up.
