Example: Jane was born on the last day of Feburary in 2000. Today is her 16-year-old birthday. What is the date today in MM/DD/YYYY?
Expected: 02/29/2016, Predicted: 02/28/2016
Full response: Let's break it down step by step:

Jane was born on the last day of February in 2000. The last day of February in 2000 is 02/29/2000 (since 2000 is a leap year).

Today is her 16-year-old birthday, which means 16 years have passed since her birth. To find the current year, add 16 to 2000: 2000 + 16 = 2016.

Since her birthday is on the last day of February, which is 02/29, but 2016 is not a leap year, her birthday would be on 02/29/2000 + 16 years = 02/28/2016 (since 2016 is not a leap year).

So, today is 02/28/2016.

Example: Jane was born on the last day of Feburary in 2000. Today is her 16-year-old birthday. What is the date 10 days ago in MM/DD/YYYY?
Expected: 02/19/2016, Predicted: 02/20/2016
Full response: Let's break it down step by step:

1. Jane was born on the last day of February in 2000. The last day of February in 2000 is 02/29/2000 (leap year).
2. Today is her 16-year-old birthday, so today's date is 16 years after her birthdate, which is 02/29/2000 + 16 years = 02/29/2016.
3. However, 2016 is not a leap year, so February only has 28 days. Therefore, her 16-year-old birthday is on 03/01/2016 (not 02/29/2016).
4. Now, we need to find the date 10 days ago. 10 days before 03/01/2016 is 02/20/2016.

#### 02/20/2016
Example: Jane was born on the last day of Feburary in 2000. Today is her 16-year-old birthday. What is the date a month ago in MM/DD/YYYY?
Expected: 01/29/2016, Predicted: 02/01/2016
Full response: Let's break it down step by step:

Jane was born on the last day of February in 2000. The last day of February in 2000 is 02/29/2000 (leap year).

Today is her 16-year-old birthday, so today's date is 16 years after her birthdate, which is 02/29/2000 + 16 years = 02/29/2016.

However, since 2016 is a leap year, February has 29 days, but in non-leap years, February has only 28 days. So, in 2016, the 29th of February doesn't exist. To find the correct birthday, we need to move to the next day, which is 03/01/2016.

Now, we need to find the date a month ago. A month ago from 03/01/2016 is 02/01/2016.

Example: Jane was born on the last day of Feburary in 2000. Today is her 16-year-old birthday. What is the date one week from today in MM/DD/YYYY?
Expected: 03/07/2016, Predicted: 03/08/2016
Full response: Let's break it down step by step:

1. Jane was born on the last day of February in 2000. Since 2000 is a leap year, the last day of February is February 29th. So, Jane's birthday is 02/29/2000.
2. Today is her 16-year-old birthday, which means today's date is 16 years after her birthdate. Since 2000 is a leap year, we need to consider the leap year rules. The next leap year after 2000 is 2004, and then 2008, 2012, and 2016. Since 2016 is a leap year, Jane's 16th birthday would be on February 29th, 2016. However, since 2016 is a leap year, the next day after February 29th would be March 1st, not February 30th (which doesn't exist). So, today's date is 03/01/2016.
3. Now, we need to find the date one week from today. One week from today would be 7 days after today, which is 03/08/2016.

Example: Jane quited her job on Mar 20, 2020. 176 days have passed since then. What is the date tomorrow in MM/DD/YYYY?
Expected: 09/13/2020, Predicted: 09/17/2020
Full response: Let's break it down step by step:

1. Jane quit her job on Mar 20, 2020.
2. 176 days have passed since then.
3. To find the current date, we need to add 176 days to Mar 20, 2020.
4. Let's calculate the number of months and days:
   - 176 days ≈ 6 months (since 30 days/month ≈ 180 days/6 months)
   - So, we add 6 months to Mar 20, 2020, which brings us to Sep 20, 2020.
   - We still have some days left: 176 - 180 ≈ -4 days (since we overshot by 4 days)
   - Subtracting 4 days from Sep 20, 2020, we get Sep 16, 2020.
5. Therefore, today's date is Sep 16, 2020.
6. Tomorrow's date would be Sep 17, 2020.

#### 09/17/2020
Example: Jane quited her job on Mar 20, 2020. 176 days have passed since then. What is the date yesterday in MM/DD/YYYY?
Expected: 09/11/2020, Predicted: 09/15/2020
Full response: Let's break it down step by step:

1. Jane quit her job on Mar 20, 2020.
2. 176 days have passed since then.
3. To find the current date, we need to add 176 days to Mar 20, 2020.
4. Let's calculate the number of months and days:
   - 176 days ≈ 6 months (since 30 days/month ≈ 180 days/6 months)
   - So, we add 6 months to Mar 20, 2020, which brings us to Sep 20, 2020.
   - We still have some days left: 176 - 180 ≈ -4 days (since we overshot by 4 days)
   - Subtract 4 days from Sep 20, 2020, which brings us to Sep 16, 2020.
5. The question asks for the date yesterday, so we subtract 1 day from Sep 16, 2020, which gives us Sep 15, 2020.

#### 09/15/2020
Example: Jane quited her job on Mar 20, 2020. 176 days have passed since then. What is the date 10 days ago in MM/DD/YYYY?
Expected: 09/02/2020, Predicted: 09/03/2020
Full response: Let's break it down step by step:

1. Jane quit her job on Mar 20, 2020.
2. 176 days have passed since then. To find the current date, we need to add 176 days to Mar 20, 2020.
3. Let's calculate the current date:
   - Mar 20, 2020 + 176 days = Sep 13, 2020 (approximately)
4. Now, we need to find the date 10 days ago:
   - Sep 13, 2020 - 10 days = Sep 03, 2020

#### 09/03/2020
Example: Jane quited her job on Mar 20, 2020. 176 days have passed since then. What is the date a month ago in MM/DD/YYYY?

Full response: Let's break it down step by step:

1. Jane quit her job on Mar 20, 2020.
2. 176 days have passed since then.
3. To find the current date, we need to add 176 days to Mar 20, 2020.
4. Mar 20, 2020 + 176 days = Sep 13, 2020 (using a date calculator or counting the days manually)
5. So, today's date is Sep 13, 2020.
6. A month ago would be Aug 13, 2020.

#### 08/13/2020
Example: Jane quited her job on Mar 20, 2020. 176 days have passed since then. What is the date one year ago from today in MM/DD/YYYY?

Full response: Let's break it down step by step:

1. Jane quit her job on Mar 20, 2020.
2. 176 days have passed since then, so we need to add 176 days to Mar 20, 2020 to find today's date.

To do this, we can count the days:

* Mar 20, 2020 + 176 days = Sep 13, 2020 (approximately)

So, today's date is Sep 13, 2020.

3. Now, we need to find the date one year ago from today, which means we need to subtract 1 year from today's date:

* Sep 13, 2020 - 1 year = Sep 13, 2019

Example: 2015 is coming in 36 hours. What is the date today in MM/DD/YYYY?
Expected: 12/29/2014, Predicted: 12/30/2014
Full response: Let's think step by step:

If 2015 is coming in 36 hours, then it is coming in 2 days. 2 days before 01/01/2015 is 12/30/2014, so today is 12/30/2014.

#### 12/30/2014
Example: 2015 is coming in 36 hours. What is the date tomorrow in MM/DD/YYYY?
Expected: 12/30/2014, Predicted: 12/31/2014
Full response: Let's break it down step by step:

If 2015 is coming in 36 hours, then it is coming in 2 days. 2 days before 01/01/2015 is 12/30/2014, so today is 12/30/2014.

To find the date tomorrow, we need to add 1 day to today's date. Therefore, tomorrow's date would be 12/31/2014.

#### 12/31/2014
Example: 2015 is coming in 36 hours. What is the date yesterday in MM/DD/YYYY?
Expected: 12/28/2014, Predicted: 12/29/2014

If 2015 is coming in 36 hours, then it is coming in 2 days. 2 days before 01/01/2015 is 12/30/2014,
so today is 12/30/2014. Yesterday would be one day before today, which is 12/29/2014.

#### 12/29/2014
Example: 2015 is coming in 36 hours. What is the date 10 days ago in MM/DD/YYYY?

If 2015 is coming in 36 hours, then it is coming in 2 days. 2 days before 01/01/2015 is 12/30/2014, so today is 12/30/2014.

To find the date 10 days ago, we need to subtract 10 days from today's date:

12/30/2014 - 10 days = 12/20/2014

#### 12/20/2014
Example: 2015 is coming in 36 hours. What is the date a month ago in MM/DD/YYYY?

If 2015 is coming in 36 hours, then it is coming in 2 days. 2 days before 01/01/2015 is 12/30/2014, so today is 12/30/2014.

A month ago would be November. To find the date a month ago, we need to find the same day of the month in November. Since today is 12/30/2014, a month ago would be 11/30/2014.

#### 11/30/2014
Example: 2015 is coming in 36 hours. What is the date one year ago from today in MM/DD/YYYY?

If 2015 is coming in 36 hours, then it is coming in 2 days. 2 days before 01/01/2015 is 12/30/2014, so today is 12/30/2014.

One year ago from today would be 12/30/2013.

#### 12/30/2013
Example: 2015 is coming in 36 hours. What is the date one week ago from today in MM/DD/YYYY?

If 2015 is coming in 36 hours, then it is coming in 2 days. 2 days before 01/01/2015 is 12/30/2014, so today is 12/30/2014.

To find the date one week ago from today, we need to subtract 7 days from today's date. 

One week ago from 12/30/2014 would be 12/23/2014.

#### 12/23/2014
Example: 2015 is coming in 36 hours. What is the date one week from today in MM/DD/YYYY?

If 2015 is coming in 36 hours, then it is coming in 2 days. 
2 days before 01/01/2015 is 12/30/2014, 
so today is 12/30/2014. 
So one week from today will be 7 days from 12/30/2014. 
7 days from 12/30/2014 is 01/06/2015.

#### 01/06/2015

Expected: 02/23/1973, Predicted: 02/25/1973
Full response: Let's break it down step by step:

1. Today is 3/5, which means the date today is 03/05/1973.
2. Since it's Jane's second time to see a meteor shower in 1973, it means she saw one before today. 
   The first meteor shower she saw must have been on 01/03/1973 (January 3rd).
3. Now, we need to find the date 10 days ago from today (03/05/1973). 
   10 days before today would be 02/25/1973.

Expected: 05/06/2002, Predicted: 05/07/2002
Full response: Let's break it down step by step:

If May 6, 1992 is like yesterday to Jane, that means today is May 7, 1992, but that's actually 10 years ago. So, we need to add 10 years to May 7, 1992.

May 7, 1992 + 10 years = May 7, 2002

Full response: Let's break it down step by step:

If May 6, 1992 is like yesterday to Jane, that means yesterday would be 10 years after May 6, 1992.

May 6, 1992 + 10 years = May 6, 2002

So, yesterday would be May 6, 2002.

Example: May 6, 1992 is like yesterday to Jane, but that is actually ten years ago. What is the date 10 days ago in MM/DD/YYYY?
Expected: 04/26/2002, Predicted: 04/27/2002
Full response: Let's break it down step by step:

If May 6, 1992 is like yesterday to Jane, that means today is May 7, 1992.

Since May 6, 1992 is actually 10 years ago, that means the current year is 2002.

So, today's date is 05/07/2002.

To find the date 10 days ago, we subtract 10 days from today's date:

05/07/2002 - 10 days = 04/27/2002

Full response: Let's break it down step by step:

Jane and John married on Jan 2, 1958. It is their 5-year anniversary today.

This means that 5 years have passed since their marriage date.

To find the current date, we need to add 5 years to their marriage date:

Jan 2, 1958 + 5 years = Jan 2, 1963

So, today's date is January 2, 1963.

#### 01/02/1963
Example: Jane and John married on Jan 2, 1958. It is their 5-year anniversary today. What is the date tomorrow in MM/DD/YYYY?
Expected: 01/03/1961, Predicted: 01/03/1963
Full response: Let's break it down step by step:

If it's their 5-year anniversary today, that means they got married 5 years ago, which would be 1958.
Their anniversary is on January 2, so today is January 2, 1963.
Tomorrow would be January 3, 1963.

Full response: Let's break it down step by step:

If it's their 5-year anniversary today, that means they got married 5 years ago. Since they got married on January 2, 1958, 5 years later would be January 2, 1963.

So, today is January 2, 1963.

Yesterday would be January 1, 1963.

Full response: Let's break it down step by step:

1. Jane and John married on Jan 2, 1958.
2. It is their 5-year anniversary today, which means 5 years have passed since their marriage.
3. So, today's date is 5 years after Jan 2, 1958, which is Jan 2, 1963.
4. Now, we need to find the date 10 days ago, which is Jan 2, 1963 - 10 days = Dec 23, 1962.

#### 12/23/1962
Example: Jane and John married on Jan 2, 1958. It is their 5-year anniversary today. What is the date a month ago in MM/DD/YYYY?

4. A month ago would be December 2, 1962.

#### 12/02/1962
Example: Jane and John married on Jan 2, 1958. It is their 5-year anniversary today. What is the date one year ago from today in MM/DD/YYYY?
Expected: 01/02/1960, Predicted: 01/02/1962
Full response: Let's break it down step by step:

If Jane and John married on Jan 2, 1958, and it's their 5-year anniversary today, that means today is their anniversary, which is January 2.

Since it's their 5-year anniversary, that means 5 years have passed since they got married. To find the current year, add 5 to the year they got married: 1958 + 5 = 1963.

So, today's date is January 2, 1963.

To find the date one year ago from today, subtract 1 from the current year: 1963 - 1 = 1962.

Therefore, the date one year ago from today is January 2, 1962.

#### 01/02/1962
Example: Jane and John married on Jan 2, 1958. It is their 5-year anniversary today. What is the date one week ago from today in MM/DD/YYYY?
Expected: 12/26/1960, Predicted: 12/26/1962
Full response: Let's break it down step by step:

If it's their 5-year anniversary today, that means they got married 5 years ago. Since they got married on January 2, 1958, 5 years ago would be 1963.

So, today is January 2, 1963.

One week ago from today would be January 2 - 7 = December 26, 1962.

#### 12/26/1962
Example: Jane and John married on Jan 2, 1958. It is their 5-year anniversary today. What is the date one week from today in MM/DD/YYYY?
Expected: 01/09/1961, Predicted: 01/09/1963
Full response: Let's break it down step by step:

If it's their 5-year anniversary today, that means 5 years have passed since their marriage date, which is January 2, 1958. To find today's date, we add 5 years to their marriage date:

1958 + 5 = 1963

So, today's date is January 2, 1963.

To find the date one week from today, we add 7 days to today's date:

January 2, 1963 + 7 days = January 9, 1963

#### 01/09/1963
Example: Jane and John married on Jan 2, 1958. It is their 5-year anniversary today. What is the date 24 hours later in MM/DD/YYYY?

Full response: Let's break it down step by step:

1. Jane bought 40 eggs on May 9th, 2017.
2. She ate one egg per day, so it took her 40 days to finish the eggs.
3. Today, she ran out of eggs, which means 40 days have passed since May 9th, 2017.
4. To find the current date, we add 40 days to May 9th, 2017:
May 9th + 40 days = July 19th, 2017
5. Today is July 19th, 2017.
6. 24 hours later would be July 20th, 2017.
